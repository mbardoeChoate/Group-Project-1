# Group Homework 1: Collaboration with Git, GitHub, and Python
## Objective
This assignment is designed to simulate a real-world software development project in the field of robotics. Working in groups of 3-4, you will collaborate to develop a Python-based software for controlling a robot with a differential drivetrain, implementing odometry tracking, and managing a shooter mechanism. The project emphasizes teamwork, version control with Git and GitHub, and practical coding skills in a robotics context.

## General Instructions
* Teamwork: Form groups of 3-4 students. Assign roles but ensure cross-review across parts for a broader learning experience.
* Version Control: Use Git and GitHub for collaboration. Each team member will work on their component in separate branches, utilizing pull requests for code integration.
* Code Review: Critically review each other's pull requests. Provide constructive feedback and request changes if necessary. Approve pull requests that meet quality standards.
* Integration: Merge feature branches into the main branch upon completion and review.

### Part 1: Drivetrain

Develop the code to control the robotâ€™s differential drive. This system allows the robot to move by varying the speeds of its left and right wheels.

#### Properties and Methods

Implement properties as specified, utilizing the Motor_Controller class for motor objects.
The __init__ method should initialize motors and set wheel base, wheel radius, and gearing ratio.
Implement methods to set speeds, stop the robot, and calculate linear speeds and individual wheel speeds.

#### Recommendations

* Code Structure: Ensure your code is modular, making it easy to read, maintain, and test.
* Testing: Include unit tests for your methods to verify correct behavior under various conditions.

### Part 2: Odometry

Implement odometry to track the robot's position and orientation using the differential drive data.

#### Properties and Methods

Your __init__ method must initialize with a drivetrain object.
The update method should calculate the robot's current position (x, y) and orientation (theta) based on wheel movements.
Research differential drive odometry to accurately implement the update function.

#### Recommendations

* Mathematical Modeling: Be meticulous with your mathematical models and calculations for accurate position tracking.
* Simulation: Consider simulating the odometry system to test its accuracy before integrating it with the physical robot.

### Part 3: Shooter

Create a subsystem to control a shooter mechanism, including flywheel speed and shooting angle.

#### Properties and Methods

Use Motor_Controller objects for controlling the shooter's components.
Implement methods to set the flywheel speed and shooter angle.

#### Recommendations

Experimentation: Experiment with different speeds and angles to determine optimal settings for various shooting tasks.

### Additional Notes

* Documentation: Document your code thoroughly to help your teammates and future selves understand your logic.
* Git Practice: Make use of Git features like branching, merging, and pull requests to gain familiarity with collaborative coding practices.
* Learning Opportunity: This assignment is not just about coding but also about learning to work as part of a software development team. Take the opportunity to learn from each other.

## Deliverables

You must have your code in files named `drivetrain.py`, `odometry.py`, and `shooter.py`. Each file should 
contain the class definitions and methods as specified in the detailed class specifications below. 
The classes must be named: `Drivetrain`, `Odometry`, and `Shooter` respectively. Each of these classes must be a 
subclass of `Subsystem` which is defined in the `subsystem.py` file. 

I have created a `Motor_Controller` class for you to use in your code. You can find the class definition in the `motor_controller.py` file. 
You should include this file in your project directory and import the `Motor_Controller` class in your code.

### Detailed Class Specifications

#### Part 1: Drivetrain Class

##### Properties

* left_motor_controller: An instance of the Motor_Controller class to control the left motor.
* right_motor_controller: An instance of the Motor_Controller class to control the right motor.
* wheel_base: The distance between the two wheels on the robot (in units of your choice, but consistent across your project).
* wheel_radius: The radius of the wheels (in units of your choice, but consistent across your project).
* gearing_ratio: The ratio of motor turns to wheel turns. This determines how many rotations the motor has to make to complete one full rotation of the wheel.

##### Methods

* __init__(self, wheel_base, wheel_radius, gearing_ratio): Constructor to initialize the drivetrain with the wheel base, wheel radius, and gearing ratio. It should also instantiate the left and right motor controllers.
* set_speeds(self, left_speed, right_speed): Sets the speed of the left and right motors. The speeds are numbers between -1 and 1, where -1 is full speed backward, 1 is full speed forward, and 0 is stop.
* stop(self): Stops both the left and right motors.
* get_linear_speed(self): Calculates and returns the linear speed of the robot based on the current speeds of the left and right motors, the wheel radius, and the gearing ratio.
* get_left_speed(self): Returns the current speed setting of the left motor.
* get_right_speed(self): Returns the current speed setting of the right motor.

#### Part 2: Odometry Class

##### Properties

* drivetrain: A reference to an instance of the Drivetrain class.
* x: The current x-coordinate of the robot on the field.
* y: The current y-coordinate of the robot on the field.
* theta: The current orientation (angle) of the robot in radians.

##### Methods

* __init__(self, x, y, drivetrain): Constructor to initialize the odometry with a reference to the drivetrain object.
* update(self): Updates the robot's position (x, y) and orientation (theta) based on the current speeds of the left and right motors. This method requires applying the differential drive odometry formulas.
* get_position(self): Returns the current position and orientation of the robot as a tuple (x, y, theta).

#### Part 3: Shooter Class

##### Properties

* motor_controller_flywheel: An instance of the Motor_Controller class to control the flywheel motor.
* motor_controller_angle: An instance of the Motor_Controller class to adjust the angle of the shooter.
* motor_controller_feeder: An instance of the Motor_Controller class to control the feeder mechanism that introduces balls to the shooter.
* flywheel_speed: The current speed of the flywheel.
* angle: The current angle of the shooter mechanism.
* feeder_speed: The speed of the feeder mechanism.
* loaded: A boolean that indicates if the shooter is loaded with a ball.

##### Methods

* __init__(self): Constructor to initialize the shooter mechanism. This should create motor controllers for the flywheel, angle adjustment, and feeder.
* set_flywheel_speed(self, speed): Sets the speed of the flywheel. The speed parameter should dictate how fast the flywheel spins.
* set_angle(self, angle): Sets the angle of the shooter mechanism. The angle parameter should specify the shooting angle.
* set_feeder_speed(self, speed): Sets the speed of the feeder mechanism. This controls how fast balls are introduced to the shooter.
* set_loaded(self): Sets the loaded flag to True when a ball is loaded in the shooter.
* set_unloaded(self): Sets the loaded flag to False when the shooter is empty.
